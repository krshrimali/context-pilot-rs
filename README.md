# Context Pilot

Just the tool that answers following questions for you:

1. "What all commits ever touched this piece of code?"
2. "What are the files related to this piece of code?"
3. "Who all touched this piece of code?"

Eventually answering following questions for you: (via your own brain or LLMs)

1. "What could have caused the bug?"
2. "Why was this changed in the last month? What's the reason?"
3. "Where can I find the tests written for this code?"
4. "Where should I make the change while working on this code?"

Gist: Whether you want to find:
- **Who** wrote a particular line (author search 🧑‍💻),
- **Which** files are most related to a given section (context search 📄),
- Or **index** your whole workspace efficiently with Git history 🔥,

Context Pilot gives you **fast**, **powerful**, and **local-first** code intelligence.

## Installation

Context Pilot is available via [homebrew](https://github.com/krshrimali/homebrew-context-pilot):

```shell
brew install krshrimali/context-pilot/context-pilot
```


And via AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/contextpilot and git package
here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/contextpilot-git.

If you're not using homebrew or AUR, please build this project from source for now (we are working on adding this to other package managers):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krshrimali/context-pilot-rs.git
cd context-pilot-rs
cargo build --release
```

This will generate the binary at `./target/release/contextpilot`.

Move it to a path that's in your `$PATH` to run it globally:

```bash
cp ./target/release/contextpilot /usr/local/bin/contextpilot
```

Once done, you should be able to do: `contextpilot --help`
